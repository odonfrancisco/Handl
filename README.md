# Handl

Hey there! Thank you for checking out my second Dapp.

This dapp allows users to create a task where they contract a vendor to provide a service for them. The client locks the ETH within the smart contract until the Vendor provides the service, at which point the vendor will receive the ETH from the smart contract.

Here you can watch my demonstration + project overview https://youtu.be/nzsSHOsH7jk
